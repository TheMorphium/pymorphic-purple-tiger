# Pymorphic Purple Tiger - Pythonic Derivative
Angry Purple Tiger generates animal-based hash diegests meant to be memorable
and human-readable. Angry Purple Tiger is apt for anthropomorphizing project
names, crypto addresses, UUIDs, or any complex string of characters that
needs to be displayed in a user interface.

## Example

```js
from angry_pyple_tiger import animal_hash

digest = animal_hash('my ugly input string')
print(digest)
# => rapid grey rattlesnake
```
