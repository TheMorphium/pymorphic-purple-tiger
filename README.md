# Pymorphic Purple Tiger - Is a pythonic Derivative of Helium's Angry Purple Tiger
Pymorphic Purple Tiger generates animal-based hash digests meant to be memorable
and human-readable. Pymorphic Purple Tiger is apt for anthropomorphizing project
names, crypto addresses, UUIDs, or any complex string of characters that
needs to be displayed in a user interface.

## Example

```
from pymorphic_purple_tiger import animal_hash

digest = animal_hash('my ugly input string', style='lowercase')
print(digest)
# => rapid grey rattlesnake

# Tests
from test_tool import test_tool

# Demo
from examples import demo

```
